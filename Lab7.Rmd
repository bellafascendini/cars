## An example of a T-Test and linear regression

```{r}
# Load the datasets package (not strictly necessary since it's loaded by default)
library(datasets)

# View a list of available datasets
data()

# Load and display the "mtcars" dataset
data(mtcars)
head(mtcars)
```

T-Test

```{r}
cars %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  mutate(speed_group = if_else(speed > median(speed), 
                              "high_speed", 
                              "low_speed")) %>%
  with(t.test(dist[speed_group == "high_speed"],
              dist[speed_group == "low_speed"]))

```

Linear regression

```{r}
lm_example <- lm(mpg ~ hp + wt, data = mtcars)

```
